Best Practices for Multi Threading

1. Use immutable objects as much as possible
- Removes issue of changing the data structure altogether


2. Use synchronized keyword
- Ensures only one thread at time is allowed to change the object
- Make sure to choose which object and what block to add synchronization too
    - Might cause illegal state error


3. Use the Actor Model
- Organizes objects into actors which pass immutable messages to each other
- Each actor has only one thread at a time

4. Use atomic classes
- Have methods like get and set
- Has many effects of synchronized without the overhead

5. Use concurrent data structures
- Is thread safe
