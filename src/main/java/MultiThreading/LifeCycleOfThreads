Life Cycle of Threads

Threads can have one of the following states at any point
1. New
2. Runnable
3. Blocked
4. Wait
5. Timed Waiting
6. Terminated


1. New  - When new thread is created
        - Thread has not started running

2. Runnable - Thread could be ready to Run or Already Running

3. Blocked / Waiting State  - Thread is Temporary InActive
                            - Could be waiting for lock
                            - Could be waiting for notification
                            - Responsibility of the thread scheduler to reactivate the thread

4. Timed Waiting    - Called when thread calls a method with a time out parameter
                    - Stays in this state until time has completed or notification has received

5. Terminated State - When thread exits normally if the code has been executed
                    - When thread exists abnormally due to erronoeus event (i.e Unhandlded exception)
