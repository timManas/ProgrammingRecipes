we override the run() function, but we start a thread by calling the start() function.
So why donâ€™t we directly call the oveerridden run() function?
Why always the start function is called to execute a thread?

What happens when a function is called?
When a function is called the following operations take place:
1. The arguments are evaluated.
2. A new stack frame is pushed into the call stack.
3. Parameters are initialized.
4. Method body is executed.
5. Value is retured and current stack frame is popped from the call stack.


The purpose of start() is to create a separate call stack for the thread.
A separate call stack is created by it, and then run() is called by JVM.
