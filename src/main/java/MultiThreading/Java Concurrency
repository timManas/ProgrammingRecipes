Java Concurrency - yield(), sleep()  & join()

- We can prevent execution of a thread using
1. yield()
2. sleep()

I. yield() - If a thread is not doing anything important & if other threads or processes needs to run,
             they should run. Otherwise, the current thread will execute

             Ex. Thread1 takes 5hrs to execute
                 Thread2 takes 1min to execute
                 Thus, Thread2 has to wait 5hrs to complete =( ...not Good . This is what yield is for
                 To Allow other higher priorities to execute if the current thread is not doing anything important

           - If yield is called, it hints at the thread scheduler to pause execution
           - If yield is executed, thread scheduler checks if there are higher or same priorities and new
             thread on run/runnable state. Otherwise, it will keep executing

2. sleep() -
